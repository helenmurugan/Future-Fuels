# Future Fuels

Future Fuels is a site that provides a service to businesses who need to reduce their emissions from road transport. The intended audience are businesses who have fleets of road transport vehicles. Examples of such businesses include delivery services, emergency services, mobile services and transportation of cargo.

New legislation banning the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles will provide a challenge to businesses who need to choose between and transition to new fuel technologies, the impacts of which may not be well-understood. Future Fuels addresses this problem by providing consultancy to businesses who need to find cost-effective fuel strategies that suit their business requirements. The site provides a description of why this service is needed, basic information on the main alternatives to conventional fuels, and an opportunity to contact Future Fuels for more information about the services provided.

## Features

* ### Navigation
    * Featured at the top of all five pages for intuitive navigation, the navigation bar includes the Future Fuels logo that links to the home page, as well as links to pages for Batteries, Biofuels, Hydrogen and Contact Us.
    *  The navigation bar is fully responsive. At large screen sizes (1300px and above) the links are clickable page titles. For medium and small screen sizes a hamburger icon is used with a navigation menu that appears when the hamburger is selected. The hamburger was used for screen sizes 1299 px and below because the page title links appear squashed below this size.
    * For the logo a distinctive font was used for brand recognition and green was chosen as the colour inkeeping with the 'green' theme of the site.
    * The other navigation links are in a font which is consistent across the site.
    * The navigation bar makes it easy for users to navigate around the site without using the back button on the web browser.
    * Below the navigation bar is a styled title bar which lets the user know which page they are on (except for the home page where this title is not necessary).

* ### Why Future Fuels Section
    * This section briefly describes a problem that businesses will face in the near future. It lays out in simple terms how Future Fuels can provide a solution to this problem.

    * The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
    * The footer is identical across all five pages.

* ### Batteries, Biofuels and Hydrogen Pages
    * These three pages follow the same format for good user experience.
    * They consist of a heading which demonstrates the current or expected use of each fuel, paragraphs giving a simple description of the technology and two lists showing the pros and cons for each fuel.
    * The text is broken up into manageable short paragraphs and styled lists to keep the users attention.
    * These pages are valuable to users as they introduce new information in an intuitive and understandable way.

* ### Contact Us Page
    * The Contact Us page consists of a heading which encourages the user to fill in a form to receive back a free discovery call.
    * The form consists of input fields for first name, last name, email address, organisation, a message and a submit button.
    * This page is valuable to users as it provides a way to learn more about Future Fuels.

* ### Features Left to Implement
    * Subsequent versions of this site will include case studies/testimonials from existing clients.

## Testing
* The site has been tested and works well in different browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari.
* DevTools device toolbar was used to ensure the site is fully responsive and looks good across different screen sizes. 
* Media queries were added to the following features, where I could see features becoming squashed as the screen size got smaller. I have tested that features are all readable and easy to understand.
    * Navigation menu (hamburger appears at 1299px and below and page title navigation links are hidden).
    * Width of headings, images and paragraphs is increased for smaller screen sizes (incrementally at 1299 px and 700 px and below).
    * Font size for all text is reduced for screen sizes at 700px and below. 
    * Flexbox is reduced to two columns for screen sizes at 700px and below. 
* The form has been tested and requires inputs in all fields, except for the message textarea which is optional. The email address field will only accept an email address. The contact number field will accept numbers of a minimum length of 11 digits. The submit button works and links to a thanks.html page, thanking the user for getting in touch.

* ### Validator Testing
    * HTML 
        * No errors were returned when validating the code with the official W3C validator.
    * CSS 
        * No errors were returned when validating the code with the official (Jigsaw) validator.
    * Accessibility
        * I confirmed that the fonts and colours are easy to read. I used Lighthouse in DevTools to confirm that the each page scores well for accessibility.
