                Biofuels are made from renewable biomass sources such as plant or algae material or animal waste. The organic matter undergoes several processes such as chemical reactions, heat and fermentation to produce several different types of biofuels, such as biomethanol, bioethanol and biodiesel. Combustion of biofuels does produce CO<sub>2</sub> at the exhaust, however unlike fossil fuels, the carbon in biofuels was recently removed from the atmosphere by plants during photosynthesis. When these plants are turned into biofuel and then combusted, the CO<sub>2</sub> is simply returned to the atmosphere. This is very different to combustion of fossil-fuels which is not a carbon-neutral process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Biofuels can be used for both small and large road vehicles, they are often blended with conventional fossil fuels such as bioethanol/unleaded petrol blends. These can be used with no alterations to existing infrastructure or engines.  In Bristol, UK there was a 40-seater passenger bus powered entirely by biomethane from human poo (the ‘poo-bus’ ran on Route Number 2!). The biomethane was produced from sludge at the local sewage works, converting a waste product into a green fuel. However, one of the biggest issues with biofuel production is that there just isn’t enough waste and organic matter available to produce enough biofuel for the huge demands of road transport. Another consideration is the huge amounts of energy required to produce biofuel; this would need to come from renewable sources if this were to be a truly green fuel.

                Hydrogen is considered a promising fuel of the future as it contains no carbon, therefore no carbon dioxide is emitted at the exhaust. Hydrogen can either be combusted in an engine, or converted to electricity using a fuel cell (which is more efficient and therefore the more popular option). It takes only minutes to refuel a hydrogen car to full capacity and the driving range is similar to conventional cars. Whilst there are hydrogen passenger cars on the roads today, hydrogen fuel is considered more favourable for larger modes of transport like buses and trucks which require fast and regular refuelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to consider the hydrogen production method; most hydrogen is currently produced by steam methane reforming (CH<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O → CO<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>), a process which produces significant amounts of carbon dioxide. For this production method to be considered clean, the carbon dioxide would need to be captured and stored, for example stored underground – this is a whole separate area of research and not a simple and available solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another method of producing hydrogen is by electrolysis of water (2H<sub>2</sub>O → 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>), powered by a renewable source of electricity such as solar or wind, but this would be less efficient than using the electricity directly to power a vehicle and therefore makes little sense for passenger vehicles but may be an option for larger road vehicles (where batteries are problematic).

                Compressed air vehicles simply use pressurised air as the fuel; when the air is released it creates a force that propels the car forward (similar to how an untied balloon moves when released). Whilst this method is a very green approach (just using air directly from the atmosphere), a major issue is that this type of vehicle is the least efficient compared to all other options thereby losing a lot of useful energy during the compression stage. This approach is a relatively new technology and likely to be more useful for smaller vehicles.
