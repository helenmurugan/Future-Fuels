# Future Fuels

Future Fuels is a site that provides a service to businesses who need to reduce their emissions from road transport. The intended audience are businesses who have fleets of road transport vehicles. Examples of such businesses include delivery services, emergency services, mobile services and transportation of cargo.

New legislation banning the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles will provide a challenge to businesses who need to choose between and transition to new fuel technologies, the impacts of which may not be well-understood. Future Fuels addresses this problem by providing consultancy to businesses who need to find cost-effective fuel strategies that suit their business requirements. The site provides a description of why this service is needed, basic information on the main alternatives to conventional fuels, and an opportunity to contact Future Fuels for more information about the services provided.

## Features

    * Featured at the top of all five pages for intuitive navigation, the navigation bar includes the Future Fuels logo that links to the home page, as well as links to pages for Batteries, Biofuels, Hydrogen and Contact Us.
    *  The navigation bar is fully responsive. At large screen sizes (1300px and above) the links are clickable page titles. For medium and small screen sizes a hamburger icon is used with a navigation menu that appears when the hamburger is selected. The hamburger was used for screen sizes 1299 px and below because the page title links appear squashed below this size.
