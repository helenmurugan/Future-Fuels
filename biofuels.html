                Biofuels are made from renewable biomass sources such as plant or algae material or animal waste. The organic matter undergoes several processes such as chemical reactions, heat and fermentation to produce several different types of biofuels, such as biomethanol, bioethanol and biodiesel. Combustion of biofuels does produce CO<sub>2</sub> at the exhaust, however unlike fossil fuels, the carbon in biofuels was recently removed from the atmosphere by plants during photosynthesis. When these plants are turned into biofuel and then combusted, the CO<sub>2</sub> is simply returned to the atmosphere. This is very different to combustion of fossil-fuels which is not a carbon-neutral process.

                Biofuels can be used for both small and large road vehicles, they are often blended with conventional fossil fuels such as bioethanol/unleaded petrol blends. These can be used with no alterations to existing infrastructure or engines.  In Bristol, UK there was a 40-seater passenger bus powered entirely by biomethane from human poo (the ‘poo-bus’ ran on Route Number 2!). The biomethane was produced from sludge at the local sewage works, converting a waste product into a green fuel. However, one of the biggest issues with biofuel production is that there just isn’t enough waste and organic matter available to produce enough biofuel for the huge demands of road transport. Another consideration is the huge amounts of energy required to produce biofuel; this would need to come from renewable sources if this were to be a truly green fuel.
