                Battery power is the ideal solution for smaller vehicles such as motorbikes and passenger vehicles. Battery cars are already on our roads today and are available from many car manufacturers. The batteries can be charged overnight through charging points connected to the grid at your home. If the electricity used to charge the batteries is generated from renewable sources such as solar or wind power, the whole process is considered carbon-neutral. Better still, these types of transport emit zero harmful emissions from the exhaust.

                Most of us are used to refuelling our cars at petrol stations within minutes. Transitioning to battery cars, may take some getting used to. Whilst it is possible to charge the car overnight, or even during the day at work, recharging can take hours. This is fine for the daily commute but not so much for long distance travel.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Batteries are a great solution for small vehicles, however, larger vehicles require larger batteries! Buses and trucks can in theory be powered by batteries, however the batteries required would be very heavy. Since these vehicles (plus contents) have legal weight limits, then carrying a heavy battery means reduced capacity onboard – not good! As the vehicle size and battery weight increases, the energy efficiency also goes down. So for larger road vehicles, such as heavy goods vehicles, the battery required would be prohibitively heavy – and therefore we need alternative solutions.

            <p>
                Biofuels are made from renewable biomass sources such as plant or algae material or animal waste. The organic matter undergoes several processes such as chemical reactions, heat and fermentation to produce several different types of biofuels, such as biomethanol, bioethanol and biodiesel. Combustion of biofuels does produce CO<sub>2</sub> at the exhaust, however unlike fossil fuels, the carbon in biofuels was recently removed from the atmosphere by plants during photosynthesis. When these plants are turned into biofuel and then combusted, the CO<sub>2</sub> is simply returned to the atmosphere. This is very different to combustion of fossil-fuels which is not a carbon-neutral process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Biofuels can be used for both small and large road vehicles, they are often blended with conventional fossil fuels such as bioethanol/unleaded petrol blends. These can be used with no alterations to existing infrastructure or engines.  In Bristol, UK there was a 40-seater passenger bus powered entirely by biomethane from human poo (the ‘poo-bus’ ran on Route Number 2!). The biomethane was produced from sludge at the local sewage works, converting a waste product into a green fuel. However, one of the biggest issues with biofuel production is that there just isn’t enough waste and organic matter available to produce enough biofuel for the huge demands of road transport. Another consideration is the huge amounts of energy required to produce biofuel; this would need to come from renewable sources if this were to be a truly green fuel.

            <p>
                Hydrogen is considered a promising fuel of the future as it contains no carbon, therefore no carbon dioxide is emitted at the exhaust. Hydrogen can either be combusted in an engine, or converted to electricity using a fuel cell (which is more efficient and therefore the more popular option). It takes only minutes to refuel a hydrogen car to full capacity and the driving range is similar to conventional cars. Whilst there are hydrogen passenger cars on the roads today, hydrogen fuel is considered more favourable for larger modes of transport like buses and trucks which require fast and regular refuelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to consider the hydrogen production method; most hydrogen is currently produced by steam methane reforming (CH<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O → CO<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>), a process which produces significant amounts of carbon dioxide. For this production method to be considered clean, the carbon dioxide would need to be captured and stored, for example stored underground – this is a whole separate area of research and not a simple and available solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another method of producing hydrogen is by electrolysis of water (2H<sub>2</sub>O → 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>), powered by a renewable source of electricity such as solar or wind, but this would be less efficient than using the electricity directly to power a vehicle and therefore makes little sense for passenger vehicles but may be an option for larger road vehicles (where batteries are problematic).
